Of course. Here is a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for "Aegis," including user flows, a list of endpoints, detailed architecture, and descriptions of all necessary components to build and deploy the project on the Flare Network.

## **Aegis: Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

### **1. Introduction & Vision**

**1.1 Vision:** To establish Aegis as the indispensable intelligent middleware layer for the Flare Network, transforming the Flare Data Connector (FDC) into a programmable, high-integrity data pipeline. Our vision is to make Flare the undisputed leading platform for developers building robust, data-dependent dApps by providing the tools for programmable data integrity.

**1.2 Problem Statement:** The Flare Data Connector (FDC) is a powerful protocol for attesting to data from external sources, but it operates as a "dumb pipe." It can prove that an API returned a specific value, but it cannot attest to the intrinsic *correctness*, *quality*, or *context* of that value.[1, 2] This forces developers of high-value dApps (e.g., parametric insurance, prediction markets) to place complete trust in a single, centralized data source, creating a significant single point of failure and a barrier to building truly decentralized, resilient applications.[3]

**1.3 Proposed Solution:** Aegis is a decentralized protocol and developer toolkit that solves this problem. It introduces a marketplace of specialized, containerized AI agents that can be composed into complex, auditable workflows. These workflows fetch, process, cross-reference, verify, and enrich data *before* it is submitted for final FDC attestation. This architecture directly leverages proven concepts in multi-agent orchestration to provide a robust solution.[4]

**1.4 Target Audience:**

  * **Primary:** dApp developers building on the Flare Network whose applications rely on external data (DeFi, insurance, gaming, prediction markets, etc.).
  * **Secondary:** AI/ML developers and data scientists looking to monetize their skills by creating and deploying specialized data-processing agents on the Aegis marketplace.

### **2. User Flows**

**2.1 Persona 1: The dApp Developer ("Diana")**

  * **Goal:** To source high-integrity, multi-source verified weather data for her parametric insurance dApp.

  * **Flow:**

    1.  **Discovery:** Diana discovers Aegis through Flare's developer documentation.[5]
    2.  **Installation:** She installs the Aegis SDK into her Hardhat development environment.
    3.  **Browse Marketplace:** Using the SDK or a future web UI, Diana browses the Aegis Agent Marketplace. She finds three agents: `WeatherApiAgent` (supports multiple APIs), `DataCrossReferencerAgent`, and `FDCSubmitterAgent`.
    4.  **Define Workflow:** In a YAML or JSON file, Diana defines a workflow:
          * **Step 1:** Use `WeatherApiAgent` to fetch temperature data for a specific location from three different meteorological APIs.
          * **Step 2:** Pipe the outputs of Step 1 into the `DataCrossReferencerAgent` to calculate a median value and flag outliers.
          * **Step 3:** Pipe the verified median value into the `FDCSubmitterAgent` to request a formal FDC attestation.
    5.  **Execution:** From her backend, Diana uses the Aegis SDK's `executeWorkflow` function, passing in her defined workflow and payment in FLR.
    6.  **Monitoring:** The SDK returns a `jobId`. Diana's application can poll the Aegis smart contracts with this `jobId` to check the status of the workflow.
    7.  **Result:** Once complete, the `FDCSubmitterAgent` triggers the FDC, and the final, verified data is available on-chain for her insurance smart contract to consume.[6]

**2.2 Persona 2: The Agent Creator ("Alex")**

  * **Goal:** To build and monetize a specialized AI agent that performs sentiment analysis on social media data.

  * **Flow:**

    1.  **Develop Agent:** Alex, an AI developer, uses his expertise to write a Python script that takes a text input and returns a sentiment score.
    2.  **Use Aegis SDK:** He uses the Aegis Agent SDK to wrap his script. The SDK provides boilerplate for handling inputs, outputs, and state.
    3.  **Containerize:** Following the SDK documentation, Alex packages his agent into a Docker container.[4]
    4.  **Register Agent:** He uses the Aegis SDK's `registerAgent` function. This function prompts him to define metadata (name, description, input/output schema, price per execution) and submits a transaction to the on-chain Agent Registry smart contract.
    5.  **Deployment:** Alex deploys his containerized agent to a cloud service (e.g., Google Cloud, leveraging Flare's grant program credits [7]).
    6.  **Monetization:** When a developer like Diana uses Alex's `SentimentAnalysisAgent` in a workflow, the Aegis protocol's Job contract automatically routes the specified fee to Alex's registered wallet address upon successful execution.

### **3. Detailed Architecture**

Aegis operates on a hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture to combine the trustless security of Flare with the computational flexibility required for AI agents.

**3.1 On-Chain Components (Flare Network)**

  * **`AgentRegistry.sol` (Smart Contract):** An on-chain, upgradeable registry of all available agents in the marketplace.
      * Stores agent metadata: `agentId`, `ownerAddress`, `endpointUrl`, `inputSchemaHash`, `outputSchemaHash`, `pricePerExecution`.
      * Manages agent registration and updates.
  * **`JobFactory.sol` (Smart Contract):** A factory contract for creating new workflow jobs.
      * Receives workflow execution requests from users.
      * Deploys a new `Job.sol` contract for each request, transferring the user's payment for escrow.
  * **`Job.sol` (Smart Contract):** An escrow and state management contract for a single workflow execution.
      * Holds the total payment (agent fees + protocol fees) in escrow.
      * Tracks the state of the workflow (`Pending`, `InProgress`, `Completed`, `Failed`).
      * Receives proofs of execution from the off-chain Orchestrator.
      * Releases milestone payments to agent creators and the protocol DAO upon verified completion of each step.

**3.2 Off-Chain Components**

  * **Aegis Orchestrator:** A decentralized network of nodes (initially run by the core team) responsible for managing workflow execution.
      * **API Layer (FastAPI):** Exposes REST endpoints for users to submit and monitor workflows.
      * **Workflow Engine (LangGraph):** The core of the orchestrator. It parses the user's declarative workflow definition and compiles it into an executable stateful graph.[8, 4]
      * **Flare Event Listener:** Monitors the `JobFactory` for new job requests.
      * **Execution Coordinator:** For each active job, it calls the appropriate containerized AI agents in the sequence defined by the LangGraph, passing the necessary inputs.
      * **Proof Submitter:** After an agent completes its task, the coordinator generates a proof of execution (containing the output and a signature) and submits it to the corresponding `Job.sol` contract to unlock the next milestone payment.
  * **Containerized AI Agents (Docker):** The individual tools in the marketplace, run by their creators.
      * Each agent is a self-contained web service (e.g., a simple Python Flask/FastAPI app inside a Docker container) that exposes a standardized endpoint for the Orchestrator to call.
      * This architecture allows for maximum flexibility in language and dependencies, as the Orchestrator only needs to know the agent's HTTP endpoint.
